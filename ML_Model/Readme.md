This module implements a shallow decision tree classifier for power system fault detection using hardware-friendly features extracted from three-phase voltage and current signals. The decision tree is trained with limited depth to ensure interpretability and direct mapping to Verilog comparator-based logic. After training, the model is frozen and its decision rules are exported as fixed thresholds, enabling deterministic and synthesizable hardware implementation. This approach provides accurate fault classification while maintaining low computational complexity suitable for real-time digital protection systems.
