This module implements the preprocessing pipeline for a power system fault detection framework by converting raw three-phase voltage and current waveforms into a fixed-length, fixed-point dataset suitable for Verilog implementation. The continuous time-domain signals are segmented into one-cycle windows (20 ms at 50 Hz), filtered to ensure label consistency, and quantized into 16-bit signed fixed-point representation to enable deterministic FPGA-based processing. The resulting Verilog-ready dataset provides integer-only, hardware-compatible inputs for feature extraction, decision tree training, and real-time fault classification.
