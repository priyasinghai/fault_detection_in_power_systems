This module performs hardware-efficient feature extraction from preprocessed three-phase voltage and current data for power system fault detection. Each fixed-length window is converted into a small set of physically meaningful time-domain features, including peak and RMS-squared values of phase currents and peak values of phase voltages. These features capture essential fault characteristics while significantly reducing data dimensionality and computational complexity. The extracted features are integer-only and directly compatible with comparator-based decision tree logic, enabling deterministic and low-latency Verilog implementation.
